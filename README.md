# Hybrid Self-Supervised and Classical Machine Vision for Polyp Segmentation

## Overview
This project explores a hybrid approach for automated polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images by integrating self-supervised learning (SSL) and classical machine vision techniques. The resulting model, **PolyFusionNet**, addresses key challenges in clinical polyp detection, including data scarcity, domain variability, and model interpretability.

## Motivation
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Early polyp detection during colonoscopy significantly improves outcomes but remains challenging due to imaging variability and human error. Our approach enhances segmentation accuracy and robustness using a fusion of handcrafted features and deep learning representations.

## Key Features
- ‚öôÔ∏è **PolyFusionNet Architecture**:
  - Combines classical edge-based feature extraction with a transformer-based encoder.
  - Uses MoCo-v2 for SSL pretraining to learn rich visual representations.

- üìà **Datasets**:
  - `HyperKvasir`: 99k+ unlabeled images for self-supervised pretraining.
  - `CVC-ClinicDB`: Expert-annotated images for supervised fine-tuning and evaluation.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Dice Score
- IoU (Intersection over Union)
- Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity
- Comparative performance vs. PraNet, ACSNet, ColonSegNet, Polyp-PVT

## Results
- Significant improvements in generalization and robustness under domain shifts.
- PolyFusionNet outperforms baseline and achieves competitive performance with fewer annotations.
- Strong interpretability due to classical feature integration.
